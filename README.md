# Movie Recommender System

This project aims to develop a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques. By analyzing user preferences and similarities between users, the recommender system suggests movies that align with the user's tastes and preferences. The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations, enhancing the user's movie-watching experience and helping them discover new films of interest.

## Project Overview

Movie recommender systems have gained significant popularity due to the vast amount of available movie options. These systems leverage user preferences and similarities to recommend movies that align with the user's taste. In this project, we focus on developing a collaborative filtering-based movie recommender system. By analyzing user ratings and movie similarities, we aim to provide personalized movie recommendations and enhance the user's movie-watching experience.

## Data Collection

To build an effective movie recommender system, we collected a comprehensive dataset of movie ratings from various sources, including movie review platforms, online databases, and user-contributed data. The dataset includes information such as movie titles, user IDs, ratings, and timestamps. We ensured data privacy and followed ethical guidelines during the data collection process.

## Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique in recommender systems that analyzes user behavior and item similarities to generate recommendations. In this project, we employ collaborative filtering algorithms, such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, to identify patterns and similarities between users and movies. By leveraging these techniques, we can suggest movies to users based on the preferences and ratings of similar users.

## Model Training

To train our movie recommender system, we utilized the collected dataset and implemented collaborative filtering algorithms. We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models accurately. By measuring metrics such as precision, recall, and Mean Average Precision (MAP), we assessed the effectiveness of the models and fine-tuned their parameters to optimize performance.

## Web Application

To provide a user-friendly interface for the movie recommender system, we developed a web application using Flask, a Python web framework. The application allows users to input their movie preferences and receives personalized movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering techniques. The recommendations are presented in an intuitive and interactive manner, enabling users to explore suggested movies and discover new films of interest.
